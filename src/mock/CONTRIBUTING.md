## Planned Improvements

- The `@MockWith` annotation can only be placed on code that you own.  Thus, we can't mock code that we don't own.  This is problematic, because code that we don't own is often exactly the code that we want to mock.  This problem can be solved by creating a mechanism that would allow the user to specify a list of tuples T = [(L,R)], where L is the fully-qualified name of a method to be mocked, and R is the fully-qualified name of a mock.  Our aspect code would then do what it currently does using `@MockWith`, but for T.map(t => t.L).
